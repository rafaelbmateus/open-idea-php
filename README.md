# Project Open Idea

The idea is to build an open platform for innovation, bringing the academics to companies.

The plataform is a great idea, but the start will make the skeleton to work.

## TODO:
Companies publishing challenges;
External sources help you complete the challenge;
Apply a gamification to users to help complete the challenge;
Allow users to register with public and private ideas in plataform, documenting their ideas;
Allow Users to comment on the challenges or ideas;
Allow Users compartilher challenges or ideas;
And other things that are on his head ...

The idea is to build a platform on rails, but I preferred to make a Prototypo in php since I'm familiar, then that is structured build the application in ruby on rails
